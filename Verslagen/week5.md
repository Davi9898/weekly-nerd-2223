Adapting to Reality
Web design & Development is hard
It all started with 640x480 screen sizes. Fixed size web pages were built.
Then it went to 800x600 screens
Screens kept getting bigger
1024x768 The web's happy place. Niet iedereen kon een telefoon betalen met een browser. 
Until the first Iphone came on the market. The first good web experience was offered by a mobile phone. Media queries ontstonden. Responsive layouts
Chasing screen sizes is clearly a fool's errand
Meaning users will need to ineract in different ways
* Eye tracking
* touch
* Mouse
* remote
* pen
* braille

Over varied networks and in changing conditions
* wifi
* hardline
* mobile

Its good to keep in mind that in parts that aren't that developed in the world that you take these in consideration.

Reality check
Nothing about our users'experiences of the web has ever been as homogenous as we imagined
not all smartphones are equal when you look at the different prices between. Lower class people buy cheaper smartphones which are functionally worse than an expensive one. This might impact the web experience. 

How can we make our websites work for everyone
Approach your job with an open mind and empathy for your users.
We try stuff, make mistakes & learn from them

Considering capabilities and improving the user experience

Graceful Degration and progressive enhancement are related
all pE will provide graceful degradation

1. Focus on what matters ( what is the purpose of this interface )
2. Write it out, then read it back 
3. Look for semantics that support 1 & 2 ( choosing things like headings anchor elements etc )
4. Think about how design can improve comprehension
5. Consider how your design choices impact the reading experience.
6. Think about the many different ways folks might interact
7. Map the potential experiences.
8. iterate
